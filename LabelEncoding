Label Encoding is encoding labels as Numeric. 

For example:
  If we have dataset with a Gender feature so we label them as say Males as 1 and Females as 2.
Example2:
  Say we have a dataset which has country feature so inorder to take this feature into consideration while passing into linear
  regression, xgboost or other tree based models we do a label encoding.
    So, say in this case lets think that we have 4 country names in the label country.
    
    4 Countries are US, India, Britian, France
    
    So, we label these 4 countries from 1-4
    
    So, we assign US as 1, India as 2, Britian as 3 and France as 4.
    Here we cant compare one class is greater or smaller than other. I mean to say that 2 > 1 , this should not be done.
